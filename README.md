## 💎 What is LamaDB?

LamaDB is not just a database; it’s a **Sovereign Conductor** for your data. 

Think of it as a super-powered "Data Box" that lives on your own hardware, syncs to your private GitHub, and is governed by laws you write. It’s designed to be fast (sub-zero latency), secure (AES-256 encryption), and beautiful.

### 🚀 Why it’s superior
- **Matrix Green Theme**: A high-fidelity interface designed for 2037.
- **Sovereign CLI**: A massive 25+ command suite (`lama`) that gives you total control.
- **QBET Integration**: Bound by the laws of `lamadb.qbet`, ensuring your data stays stable and persistent.
- **GitHub Persistence**: Your data lives in YOUR private GitHub repo. No 3rd parties, no hidden fees.

## ⚡ Quick Start: Taking Control

Manifesting a LamaDB node is effortless for anyone with a terminal.

```bash
# 1. Enter the conductor
cd LamaDB

# 2. Manifest the service
node cli.js start
```

### 🌀 The Intelligence Conductor
When you start the service, you’ll see the **Sovereign Conduction Logs** in Matrix Green.
- **REST API**: Running at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1`
- **Sovereign UI**: A beautiful QUI interface available at `http://localhost:8080/ui`.

## 🛠️ The Conductor’s Toolbox (`lama`)

The `lama` CLI is your dashboard for data orchestration. It’s divided into 5 powerful categories:

- **SERVICE**: `lama start`, `lama stop`, `lama status`
- **DATA**: `lama data look`, `lama save`, `lama prune`
- **INTELLIGENCE**: `lama sync`, `lama mesh`, `lama stream`
- **GOVERNANCE**: `lama login`, `lama verify`, `lama law`
- **SYSTEM**: `lama update`, `lama diagnose`, `lama reset`

*Run `lama --help` to see the full list of 25+ commands.*
